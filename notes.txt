Why REACT?

COMPONENTS 
blocks that build up a bigger project 

react is ab event drive language, every component has a state 


rfc
//importing a react component that is from a function 
    import React from 'react'

    export default function home() {
    return (
        <div>home</div>
    )
    }

rcc 
a CLASS inheriting from a react component 
whenever anything in the state{} changes, there is a reRENDER()
render() is a method, and it is a function 

    import React, { Component } from 'react'

    export default class This extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
        <div>home</div>
        )
    }
    }

    export default function

how does state attr get set ? with the contructor() method 
use super() to call on parent constructor, so you make sure to follow them 


dynamic 
<Route path={'/:userID'} component={UserProfile}/>
